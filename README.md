# Employees Data Migration Project

## What the software does
This piece of software takes in a csv file for the Employees table, and persists it to the database.
The user can then manipulate the database with select, update and delete commands. This is done through simple user inputs in the console when prompted.

## Sprint Planning
 In creating this software, I identified and created 5 User Stories that encompassed the clients needs.
 These were the following:
  - **User Story 1**
    - As an employee
    - I would like my data to be stored in a database
    - So that it isn't stored insecurely in a spreadsheet, and I can request for it's removal.
  - **User Story 2**
    - As an admin
    - I would like to get users from the database
    - So that I can check their information is correct.
  - **User Story 3**
    - As an employee
    - I would like the ability to delete from the database
    - So that I can have my data removed if I quit.
  - **User Story 4**
    - As a user
    - I would like to update the information in the database
    - So that I can correct any wrong information.
  - **User Story 5**
     - As a user
     - I would like to see how long it takes to get my data
     - So that I can check the efficiency of the program

  ## MVP
  The first sprint goal was to finish the ***MVP*** or ***Minimum Viable Product***. This consists of the User Stories that encompassed the clients base requirements. These were identified to be:
   - User Story 1
   - User Story 2
   - User Story 5

   Of these ***User Stories***, 2 and 5 both relied on 1 so that was completed first.

   After completing the ***MVP***, User Stories 3, 4 where completed.

   ## Sprint Retrospective
   Overall the sprint went very well. I was able to incorporate all the features desired by the customer, plus a few extra features in the alotted time. For future sprints/projects, I would want to keep up this pace of work as well as focus more on making the user stories as comprehensive as possible.
